All elite football in England has been suspended until at least April 30 because of the coronavirus pandemic and there has been much debate over what should happen with the games that have yet to be played.

      Liverpool are 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League and Lineker feels that only those who want the Reds to miss out on ending their 30 year wait for the title want the campaign to be scrapped.</p> </div>

The 22-year-old has been working with charity FareShare to help children in Manchester after schools were closed.

Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Rashford said the work was "top of my to-do list" and spoke about his childhood.
    "I am just trying to impact the next generation in a positive way," he said.

The midfielder, 22, was placed in an induced coma after the incident in a pre-season game in Austria in 2017.

"He sleeps, eats, sneezes and burps but is very dependent," his brother Abderrahim told De Wereld Draait Door.

"Some communication is possible, for example raising eyebrows."

        Nouri's family have renovated a house to accommodate him out of hospital.</p>
