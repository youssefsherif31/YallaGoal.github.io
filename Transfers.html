  <div class="text"><p><b>Agent: 'No new Hakimi deal'</b>Juventus transfer target Achraf Hakimi does not have any new deal in place with Real Madrid or Borussia Dortmund, assured his agent. “We’ll wait and see.” The 21-year-old right-back has spent the last two seasons on loan at Borussia Dortmund and that agreement will conclude in June. Marca claimed this week that Real Madrid would welcome him back to base with a new deal until 2023, but that does not seem to be the case. “The contract with Real Madrid is still the one we negotiated in 2017 and that runs to June 2022,” agent Alejandro Camano told Spox. “We’ll have to wait and see. After the coronavirus crisis is over, we’ll sit down with Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund to discuss the matter.”</p></div>

  <div class="text"><p><b>Milan linked with Rakitic again</b>Milan will try again to sign Ivan Rakitic from Barcelona, claim Mundo Deportivo, but his €8m per year salary represents a big problem.
            According to the Spanish newspaper, the Rossoneri are set for a third attempt to coax Rakitic to San Siro.
            He is seen as a leadership figure and star name in midfield to help younger figures around him develop.
            The 32-year-old Croatia international’s contract with Barcelona is due to expire in June 2021 and a summer exit is not out of the question.
      However, Milan and Sevilla would find it difficult to balance the books with his €8m per season wages.</p></div>

  <div class="text"><p><b>Inter sacrifice three for Chiesa</b>Inter are ready to sacrifice Radja Nainggolan, Henrique Dalbert and Victor Moses to get Federico Chiesa from Fiorentina, claim Sportmediaset.
            According to the Italian news station, the Nerazzurri are working out a summer plan to raise funds for the €50m-rated Italy international.
            They face competition from Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United for the 22-year-old winger.
            It’s reported that Inter will provide €10m, in addition to the money raised from selling Dalbert and Nainggolan.
            They would also not activate their purchase option on Moses, who arrived from Chelsea in January with option to buy for €12m.
      Nainggolan is currently on loan at Cagliari, but it’s unlikely the Sardinians can afford to keep the Belgian full-time.</p></div>

  <img src="players_images/gotze.jpg" alt="Gotze">
  <div class="text"><p><b>Gotze open to Roma move</b>Roma are interested in Mario Götze, with reports in Germany suggesting the Borussia Dortmund striker would relish this Serie A experience.
            The 27-year-old will be a free agent in June, when his contract with BVB expires.
            He has scored three goals in 13 Bundesliga appearances for the club this season, but a new contract does not appear to be on the horizon.
            The Corriere dello Sport suggested initial talks between Roma director Gianluca Petrachi and Götze’s agent had already taken place.</p></div>
