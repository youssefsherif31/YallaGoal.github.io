Since Filippo Inzaghi retired in 2012, the nine players who have worn his old jersey have scored 29 Serie A goals between them. By way of comparison, that's only two goals more than Lazio striker Ciro Immobileâ€”Serie A's current top scorerâ€”had netted in the six months before the season was suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The experience of Krzysztof Piatek, Milan's most recent No. 9, only served to fuel talk that the shirt is cursed. After a prolific start to the 2018-19 season with Genoa, Piatek joined Milan in January 2019 but was told by then-sporting director Leonardo that the right to wear the No. 9 jersey would have to be "earned."</p></div>

Despite heading into football's shutdown two points clear of Real Madrid in La Liga and still in Champions League contention, the squad he inherited is one in need of significant changes.These are unprecedented times, with Barcelona announcing this week that for the first time they will sell the naming rights to the Nou Camp for one year in an effort to raise money for the fight against the pandemic - but who will be playing at Europe's biggest stadium once football resumes?

                <div class="text"><p><b>Thomas Meunier has spoken with JosÃ© Mourinho about a move to Tottenham.</b>Lâ€™Ã‰quipe report that 28-year-old Belgian international right-back Thomas Meunier has had a phone conversation with JosÃ© Mourinho about a possible move to Tottenham Hotspur this summer, with his PSG contract expiring this June.
Mourinho told Meunier that he wants the player in his squad next season, a discourse that seems to have gone very close to convincing the Belgian to make the move. The way that the Portuguese coach talked about Meunier in the phone call stood in stark contrast to the way that Thomas Tuchel has treated the player this season.
Secretly, Meunier still dreams of being offered a new contract by PSG, which is where he would like to stay, but is becoming increasingly resigned to the fact that Sporting Director Leonardo will not be calling him. PSG have not held any conversations with the Belgian about a possible extension at all, leaving Meunier very disappointed.
